My name is Irfan Nisar and one of my favorite hobbies is photography. I enjoy taking photos because I like to capture every moment and make memories.
 I have been doing photography for about ten years, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a new hobby. 
I also pay more attention to the moment around me, natural moments like sunrises, sunsets, fog, and rain. 
I also like to capture more moments of people's lives, especially for moments that can't be repeated
