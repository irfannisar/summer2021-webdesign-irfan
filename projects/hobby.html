    <h1>I like Photography</h1>
        <p>My name is Irfan Nisar and one of my favorite hobbies is photography. I enjoy taking photos because I like to capture every moment and make memories. I have been doing photography for about ten years, and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a new hobby. I also pay more attention to the moment around me, natural moments like sunrises, sunsets, fog, and rain. I also like to capture more moments of people's lives, especially for moments that can't be repeated.</p>

        <h2>I enjoy looking in to memories through pictuers.</h2>
        <p> If you've never done photography, don't be worried because it's quite a simple hobby to adopt into your everyday lifestyle. You don't need any fancy equipment, all you need to begin with photography is your smartphone. To get started, stick to simple images and landscapes or just the face of a person. Get rid of any distracting elements in the camera view that may otherwise ruin your photo. Try shooting images from different angles to make the photo look cooler. Use lines such as the horizon or marks in the road to add a linear dimension to your images. Be creative and remember that sometimes a minimal approach gives the best results.  </p>
